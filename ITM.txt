Idiots Turing Machine 
esolang by alan malan

how does it works?
it is based in the esolang brainfuck, it has a 1 dimentional tape (represented by the tape array) and a pointer that points the curent cell
and can change the curent cell value. and comands can work in diferent ways depending on the curent cell value
unlike in brainfuck the cell wraps back around after 256, in brainfuck a cell wraps up after 255

comand: 
 Basic tape functions
< :: moves pointer to the left
> :: moves pointer to the right
+ :: adds 1 to the curent cell
- :: subtracts 1 from the curent cell
 I/O
. :: outputs the value of the curent cell as a character (based on ascii)
: :: outputs the value of the curent cell as a integer
, :: waits till user input and stores it in the curent cell as a integer
 Halting
x :: stops the program
* :: stops the program if the curent cell value is over 0
$ :: stops the program if the curent cell value is 0
 jumping
0 :: jumps to the start of the program
# :: skips the next comand if the value of the curent cell is over 0
@ :: skips the next comand if the value of the curent cell is 0
Â¢ :: jumps to the instruction coresponding the value of the curent cell
.
programs are limited to 90 characters of lenght (gowing to be extended soon)
the interpreter is only 5 mb big
